              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>
                Howdy, I am Farris Rizwan, a junior at Texas A&M University. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. Over the years, I have developed a strong passion for programming. 
                 My coursework and personal projects have allowed me to gain a strong understanding of data structures, algorithms and software development. I am well versed in Python since it serves as the basis for my personal projects. 
                 The projects are in the Technical Portfolio section of this website. In addition, I am an intermediate to advanced C++ programmer. The Texas A&M University curriculum teaches courses like Data Structures and Algorithms in C++. 
                 In addition, I know Java, C#, and web development languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition to these technical skills, I'd like to tell you all a little about my previous job experiences. 
                 I started working when I was 16 years old. I worked as a basketball coach/referee at my local YMCA. I dealt with kids ages 4-11. Through this experience, I gained valuable skills and life lessons. 
                 The two main lessons that I learned from that experience were patience and leadership skills. I couldn't have asked for a better first job. I had to quit my job because my family relocated from our hometown in Houston, Texas, to Austin, Texas. 
                 When I moved there, I started working again. This time, I served as a customer service representative at Randall's, a nationwide grocery store chain. The new job presented a distinct challenge compared to my previous role, yet it afforded me valuable opportunities for learning and growth. 
                 This position gave me the invaluable skill of fostering calm and diplomatic communication with others. My experiences have molded me into a versatile candidate in the job market. I possess technical skills, leadership skills, and communication skills. 
                 Outside work and school, I enjoy working out, playing basketball and football, cooking, and spending time with family and friends. This website is a portfolio. It highlights my projects, skills, and experiences.
